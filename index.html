            Safety, security, and compliance are essential requirements when aligning large language models (LLMs). However, many seemingly aligned LLMs are soon shown to be susceptible to jailbreak attacks.
            These attacks aim to circumvent the models' safety guardrails and security mechanisms by introducing jailbreak prompts into malicious queries. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces 
            <strong>Defensive Prompt Patch</strong> (DPP), a novel prompt-based defense mechanism specifically designed to protect LLMs against such sophisticated jailbreak strategies. Unlike previous approaches, which have often 
            compromised the utility of the model for the sake of safety, DPP is designed to achieve a minimal Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving the high utility of LLMs. Our method uses strategically designed 
            interpretable suffix prompts that effectively thwart a wide range of standard and adaptive jailbreak techniques. Empirical results conducted on LLAMA-2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 models 
            demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of DPP, showing significant reductions in ASR with negligible impact on utility. Our approach not only outperforms existing defense strategies in balancing 
            safety and functionality, but also provides a scalable and interpretable solution applicable to various LLM platforms.

            Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models</a></li>
          <li>Overview: GCG focuses on optimizing adversarial suffixes given inputs. This method employs gradient-based optimizations to tailor the suffixes in a way that induces LLMs to generate harmful outputs for each individual 
            malicious user query. GCG attack outputs the tailored suffixes and append with the each harmful query to form the new jailbreak prompt. Such jailbreak prompts exploit model vulnerabilities,

            to optimize iterative upon a prototype jailbreak prompt and produce high quality jailbreak prompt. Unlike GCG attack, AutoDAN produces interpretable jailbreak prompts.

            <p>Overview of <strong>Defensive Prompt Patch</strong>. (a) showcases an example of jailbreak attacks. 
              (b) is the DPP training phase in which the algorithm takes in the refusal and helpful datasets and a prototype of the defense prompt. 
              Then, the algorithm forms the defense prompt population by revising the prototype using LLM. For each of the defense prompts in the population, 
              the algorithm will evaluate the defense and utility scores. The algorithm keeps editing the defense prompts with low scores using the Hierarchical Genetic Search algorithm. 
              (c) shows the deployment of DPP in the LLM inference phase, by adding the best DPP in (b) (indicated in green patch) to every input query. 
              (d) shows the trade-off graphs between the win-rate (utility) and attack success rate (ASR) in both LLAMA-2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 models for different defenses. </p>

                  <li><strong>No Malicious Intent:</strong> The jailbreak prompts and methods discussed are not designed or intended for malicious use. They are developed to provide insights into potential security weaknesses, which can be crucial for developers and researchers working on strengthening the defensive capabilities of these models.</li>
                  <li><strong>Responsible Disclosure:</strong> Prior to the publication of our findings, we engaged in a responsible disclosure process with the developers of the targeted LLMs. This was to ensure that they were aware of potential vulnerabilities and had the opportunity to address them, thereby minimizing the risk of exploitation.</li>

                  <li><strong>Limitations on Use:</strong> While we provide detailed descriptions and demonstrations of jailbreaking techniques, we do not endorse or encourage their use outside of a controlled, ethical research environment. We strongly advise against the application of these techniques in any manner that could potentially harm individuals or compromise the integrity and security of any system.</li>
                  <li><strong>Collaboration and Compliance:</strong> Our research has been conducted in collaboration with ethical security researchers and with compliance to all relevant legal and ethical guidelines. We emphasize the importance of ongoing collaboration between academia, industry, and security professionals to continue improving the security of LLMs.</li>
